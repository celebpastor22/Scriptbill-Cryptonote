Scriptbill Cryptonote Systems is a Decentralized Cryptocurrency System developed for help your business operations in Investment & Marketing. Using a decentralized banking protocol, you are in more control of your financial lifestyle.

== Description ==
Scriptbill is a Cryptocurrency based on Cryptonote Technology. Cryptonote Technology is a Cryptocurrency System whose participating Node Uses a Private and Secured Database System called the Cryptonote to communicate with other nodes in the network. This technology helps Scriptbill to perform many operations in the network that requires intelligence, which may not be possible in other Cryptocurrency networks that doesn\'t use the Cryptonote Technology. One of the possible tasks that works with the Scriptbill Cryptonote Systems is the Agreement System, which forms the core of all transactions in the Scriptbill network. The reason the Scriptbill Agreement System is best for your business is because all client wants to deal with your business with trust, with the Scriptbill Agreement System your business can easily achieve trust with your clients especially the ones you deal with using the internet.

The Scriptbill Cryptocurrency network is based on Agreements. Agreements are financial statements made to ensure the positive outcome of a transaction. Agreements are useful transactional tool because we\'ve discovered that all financial transactions are based on agreements. For instance, when you buy a Mercedes car from a dealer, you expect that the car delivered will be exactly what you saw in the advertisement; that expectation of yours is what made you commit your financial resourses into the transaction. If the expectation is not met, we say the agreement is breached. Our current financial systems do not have a sure system of handling agreements, especially without a third party. Involving a thrid party sometimes can be expensive and may raise the cost of the transaction; also, a third party can be manipulated to act alternatively to the agreement. This has made it natural for any financial stakeholder to consider risk before making any transaction, leading to the disaster we see today in our economy - Poverty.

With Agreements it will be easier for your business to:

	* Accept Automatic Investment from the decentralize Scriptbill Crypto System Using the Auto - Investment Protocol.
	* Accept Investment from Individual Investors who are interested in sharing profits with your business.
	* Execute contracts remotely and be in total control of your business financial transactions.
	
Scriptbill also uses Profit - Sharing Protocol for the purchase of any item using any credit in the Scriptbill network. Profit - Sharing is sharing Profit with your customers, contributing to their ability to purchase more. Scriptbill adopts this protocol as it's core protocol because it believes it will help the marketing of products sold using the system. Scriptbill believes that if products in the system are marketable, then it will improve the demand for the credit, making the credit healthier in the exchange market. Now, Profit - Sharing Protocol is identical to Affiliate Marketing, but more powerful because it focuses on empowering the buyer rather than rewarding the marketer for a good sales because when the buyer is empowered, he can buy more. Profit Sharing does not require any action from the buyer for reward apart from the purchase action. This alone can help merchant predicts earning rate of a particular customer's account, and can help the merchant make good crediting decisions. Businesses can take advantage of this protocol to build a strong marketing plan for their products which does not depend on the income of the society where their business operates.

The root of poverty is the reduction of the flow of financial resources. The financial security systems we have in our economy today only favor those who are rich enough to acquire financial assets and reputation that will make any financial holder to do business with such person. The reason is they feel safer with the rich who has equity that can be held on to when a financial agreement is breached. This structure will keep the poor being poor unless they find a way to break out of the poverty line, which is pratically impossible witout the help or favor of another person who has broken out. So the rich can only be rich by priviledges not hardwork.

Scriptbill has come to solve the issue of poverty with the inclusion of agreements handling in the network. This will help:

	* Business men sell more remotely; because with agreements, the customer knows that if the goods is not in the same state as it was advertised, the funds in the agreement will automatically reverse to the buyer.
	* Allow businesses to get investment from the public because they know that investing in the business will always bring them dividends and there is no way the entrepreneur can escape this.
	* Business can always give out goods on credits with agreement and sell more. With Scriptbill agreements the business can track the client\'s note that got the credit and retrieve their repayment automatically.
	* Agreements helps the Auto-Investment Feature in Scriptbills. This Feature helps the mining of Scriptbills by Investing in Business to build and create new products in the Scriptbill Network.
	
Features of the Scriptbill Cryptonote Systems:

	* Scriptbill is an Automated System. This means the transactions in the network are protected by automated task to ensure trust among financial player. For instance, Subscriptions, Budgets and Agreements in the network are handled automatically based on the information on them.
	
	* The Scriptbill Automated feature also help the network to automatically detect a business who needs investment and automatically invest into the business. This feature is called the Auto - Investment feature of Scriptbill. This feature is designed to detect businesses in the Network through the budget created by the business. 
	
	* The Scriptbill Network is a Crediting System. This means every user has the ability to create credits, which can be used for credit based transactions like loans. For instance, if Scriptbill user a will get a loan of $1000 from user B, user A can send a credit of $1000 to user B even though he has 0 Balance on his Scriptbill note. This means user B can now withdraw up to $1000 from User A's note anytime during a transaction using the credit. 
	
	* The Scriptbill Network is a Budgeting System, which makes players spend their money according to their Budgets. If the note value is lesser than the budget value, the note holder will not be able to use the money until the budget is executed.
	
	* The Scriptbill is a network of Private Databases called the Scriptbill Note System. This note holds the Private Keys and Transactional Secrets that makes the owner of the note to be able to create transactional block data into the network. Without the note, there is no way a person can add a transactional block data into the network, so you can only send and recieve money in your transaction when you have a note in the network. The note can\'t be manipulated and can only be recognized by the network if introduced to the network using a CREATE transaction. Any block introduced to the network without the CREATE transaction is invalid.
	
	* The Scriptbill network uses Profit Sharing System as the default transactional behaviour of every transaction connected to the purchase of a products in the system. This is a system of calculating the profit a business makes in the network using the budget data of the product to judge the profit value in every transaction made to the business. This is because Scriptbill believes as a business in the network, your business should be running automatically with the budget in the network, and all your business expenses whould be cleanly stated in the budget. Hence, it\'s legal enough to calculate the profit that can be shared on every transaction.
	
	* The Scriptbill network is also a Tithing System - a System I refer to as the Investment - Sharing System. The Investment - Sharing System is a System where businesses pool financial resources together in an Investment I call Tithing, because it is refered to Tithes In the Holy Scriptures; the resources are then distributed to Businesses that needs them using the Auto-Investment System. This means that as long as Businesses are integrated into Scriptbills ( Scriptbills can only recognise Businesses Using Budgets - No Budgets, even though you are selling Product, Scriptbill does not recognise you as a Business ), Your Business Must Pay Tithes and Pool Resources together by Purchasing Bonds in the exchange Market. When the Auto-Investment runs, it mines new Credit to the network if neccessary to invest to businesses that needs it and acquire Stocks. Scriptbill Stocks do pay Dividend on real time and can\'t be manipulated. Dividends gathered from these stocks are paid to Bond Holders as Interest.
	
	* Scriptbill Transactional Database is anonymous. Scriptbill transactional database is designed not to point to any wallet or note in the network, to improve privacy in the network as financial transactions are always prefered private. Two players in a transaction will communicate using encrypted data.
	
Scriptbill is a Cryptocurrency that is designed for businesses. The currency also uses automated methods to keep the currency exchange value stable. This features will help businesses store value of the currency without fear. Also, Scriptbill can be splitted into different credits that can be defined to be stable, that is based on the value of a particular fiat credit. Businesses who communicates with the fiat community can easily convert their credits into fiat, using the Scriptbill decentralized exchange system to store their financial value.
